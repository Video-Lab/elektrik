Our school has many years worth of engineering classes that teach a wide range of engineering concepts. The First class is the principals of engineering where students learn a basic understanding of engineering. the next class, engineering design and presentation teach kids how to use Autodesk inventor and at the end of the year, they take the test to become inventor certified. there are 2 other cading classes like architecture design 1 and architecture design where students learn how to use AutoCAD and can try to get a certification. after that students can take engineering science, which teaches many advanced engineering concepts that will benefit them later in their lives, such as pneumatics and electrical systems if they decide to go into engineering. a new class, engineering design and problem-solving which teaches students how to design mechanisms on an industrial scale.
